Some ideas to carry out:

- Perform analysis on streamer data set and spirelogs data set, see if answers change
  - Try to cluster players to find superpredictors?
- Try logistic regression on original data set
  - Extract multi-features. Find the Snecko Eyes + Bullet Times
- Train predictor based on deck+relics at the end of act 1
- Train AI using Forgotten Arbiter's communication mod?
